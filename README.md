# Building and install

## On Ubuntu
1) Install the dependency (SFML) ```sudo apt-get install git build-essential libsfml-dev```
2) Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/RustyBamboo/Programming-project```
3) Move to the game directory ```cd Programming-project```
4) Run cmake to generate make files ```cmake .```
5) Run make to build the game ```make```

# Running server
1) cd to game directory
2) move to build/server ```cd build/server```
3) run the server executable ```./server```

# Running the game
1) First, run a server (see above) or get the IP address of a server to connect to
2) move to build/client ```cd build/client```
3) run the game ```./game```
4) Enter the IP address into the text field
5) Press enter to begin playing

# Programming-project
COP3503 Programming Project

- "Every group member should write about 300-400 lines of code"
- We can do whatever we want (as long as it's a big project), his example was a JPEG Decompresser
- Video Game? :)

# Mlestone #1
- 7:25am Mon. October 10th -- Due (2%)
- Form your team naturally based on the common intrests...
- 7 people (Ann, Daniel, Jessica, Kevin, Kiara, Leah, Morgan)
- Grouping via CANVAS

# Milestone #2
- Analysis and Design dues at 7:25 on Monday Oct. 31 (14%)
- just a PDF
- Design (OOP!!!!)

# Milestone #3
- Implementation and Testing due 7:25am on Monday Dec.5 (14%)

Dec 8 -- Testing in front of TA ("about 5 min, then they give score 60%")


# Grading:
Defintion(20%): what is the system defintion? Why is the system important

Analysis(30%): What should be the inputs? What should be the ouputs? What are the flaw/logic rquired for the proposed system?

Design(30%): How many modules are required? What are the classes and methods for each module/component? What are the shared classes/methods across all modules?

Execution plan (20%): Whare is the best way to divide the coding takses? What will the makefile look like? Your own planned deadlines to carry out the implmentation/testing on each module?
