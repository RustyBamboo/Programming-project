Analysis(30%): What should be the inputs? What should be the ouputs? What are the flaw/logic rquired for the proposed system?

Design(30%): How many modules are required? What are the classes and methods for each module/component? What are the shared classes/methods across all modules?

Execution plan (20%): Whare is the best way to divide the coding takses? What will the makefile look like? Your own planned deadlines to carry out the implmentation/testing on each module?
